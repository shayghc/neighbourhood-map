# MyReads App

This repo contains the code for the Neighbourhood Map, Google Maps API project which is the final project of the Udacity FEND course.

Built on top of the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## Quickstart :point_left:

1. Clone the repo
2. cd into the map-app directory then run `npm install`
3. run `npm start` to activate the server.

Follow these steps to open the app in your default browser.

## Description

The map displays several points of interest indicated by markers on the map. Clicking the markers will open an info-window with more detailed information about that location.
